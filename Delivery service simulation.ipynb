    "Food delivery has become the norm in India. Ever since the pandemic started, more people are ordering from outside to avoid going out. Some restaurants have also launched their own delivery services, but it's hard to market your delivery service if you aren't a popular and big enough restaurant. So there are platforms like Zomato, Swiggy etc. which serve as a common platform allowing for customers to browse through and order from an extensive list of food outlets. These platforms also hire delivery executives to make sure people's food is delivered to their doorstep. One interesting problem in such scenario would be to find the optimal number of executives to hire, which would reduce the wait times experienced by customers during assigning of an executive to an order, whilst being within the budget. We will try to simulate this problem using the python library **simpy**, which lets us simulate real life processes like the one I just described."
